# Pewlett Hackard Analysis
---

At Pewlett Hackard like in most companies human capital matters for the ongoing company's success. The problem identified was to understand the amount of employees retiring in the next little while, specifically in which departments, what their titles were and how many were senior levels managers/employees. The latter particularly important to address mentoring program strategy. 

The data was initially only available in separate csv files. First, we build an ERD to understand the relationship between the data, i.e., how is the data connected through primary key (unique values in main table) and secondary keys (unique values in other tables)

Then added the data to a Postgres database and performed specific data requests such as determining current employees retiring soon. We then determined the total number of employees per title who will be retiring, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

In your second paragraph, summarize the steps that you took to solve the problem, as well as the challenges that you encountered along the way. This is an excellent spot to provide examples and descriptions of the code that you used.

In your final paragraph, share the results of your analysis and discuss the data that youâ€™ve generated. Have you identified any limitations to the analysis? What next steps would you recommend?
